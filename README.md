# Rebuttal of Online Item Cold-Start Recommendation with Popularity-Aware Meta-Learning, KDD 2024, Submission 123

Reviewer XxHZ:

**Q4: Lack the comparision of latest works.**

Thanks for pointing that out. The field of online recommendations and incremental updates to recommendation models is a small research field with less work. We have selected a latest work in 2023 IMSR[2] as a baseline for comparison. The results of the experiment are as follows:

|Methods|Recall@20|NDCG@20|Impr.%|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|IMSR|XX|XX|-|
|PAM-F|XX|XX|+XX%|
